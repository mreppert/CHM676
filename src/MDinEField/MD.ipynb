    "## Molecular Dynamics (MD) Integration##\n",
    "In our last exercise, we used a very simple \"hard wall\" description of the interaction of our particle with the walls of the box. A real particle, of course, interacts with other objects via various *forces* that describe how strongly the objects attract or repel each other. In this exercise, we'll treat these forces a bit more realistically. To do that, we'll need some familiarity with the concept of a *molecular dynamics integrator* -- a computer algorithm that numerically integrates Newton's laws for classical particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's second law $${\\bf F} = M {\\bf a}$$ states that the acceleration ${\\bf a} = \\ddot {\\bf x}$ of a particle is proportional to the force ${\\bf F}$ acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass $M$. Typically the force ${\\bf F}$ is derived as the (negative) gradient of an interaction potential, i.e., \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "{\\bf F}({\\bf x}) &= - \\nabla V({\\bf x})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "that describes the interaction energy of the particle with other objects (e.g., other particles or the walls of a box). In principle, if we know the functional form ${\\bf F}({\\bf x})$ for how the force $\\bf F$ varies with the position ${\\bf x}$ of the particle, we can integrate this equation to calculate the position trajectory ${\\bf x}(t)$. In practice, analytical solutions are not possible, and the equations must be solved numerically. An MD integrator does exactly this. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Euler Integration ##\n",
    "The simplest MD integrator we could use is an algorithm known as Euler's method. Suppose we are given the values ${\\bf x}(0)$ and ${\\bf v}(0)$ for the position and velocity of the particle at time $t = 0$, and we know the functional form ${\\bf F}({\\bf x})$ for the force on the particle. Euler's method then approximates the position at a very small time step time $t = \\Delta t$ away from $t = 0$ as \n",
    "$${\\bf x}(\\Delta t) \\approx {\\bf x}(0) + {\\bf v}(0) \\cdot \\Delta t . $$\n",
    "So the distance the particle moves in the time interval $\\Delta t$ is just determined by its initial velocity at $t = 0$. With this updated position ${\\bf x}(\\Delta t)$, we can now calculate the force on the particle $ {\\bf F}(\\bf{x(\\Delta t)})$ and, consequently, the acceleration \n",
    "$${\\bf a}(\\Delta t) = \\frac{{\\bf F}({\\bf x}(\\Delta t))}{M}.$$\n",
    "Finally, the velocity ${\\bf v}(\\Delta t)$ is estimated from the acceleration: since $\\dot {\\bf v}(t) = {\\bf a}(t)$,\n",
    "$${\\bf v}(\\Delta t) \\approx {\\bf v}(0) + {\\bf a}(\\Delta t) \\cdot \\Delta t.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes one step in Euler integration. With the updated parameters ${\\bf x}(\\Delta t)$ and ${\\bf v}(\\Delta t)$, we can now repeat the calculation to estimate ${\\bf x}(2 \\Delta t)$, ${\\bf a}(2 \\Delta t)$, and ${\\bf v}(2 \\Delta t)$ -- another step. Iterating the process over and over again, we obtain an estimated trajectory for ${\\bf x}(n \\Delta t)$ as \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "{\\bf x}(n \\Delta t) &\\approx {\\bf x}((n-1) \\Delta t) + {\\bf v}(n \\Delta t) \\Delta t\\\\\n",
    "{\\bf a}(n \\Delta t) &\\approx \\frac{{\\bf F}({\\bf x}(n \\Delta t) )}{M}\\\\\n",
    "{\\bf v}(n \\Delta t) &\\approx {\\bf v}((n-1) \\Delta t) + {\\bf a}(n \\Delta t) \\Delta t\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Thus, in Euler intergration the position and velocity at each time step are estimated solely from the position and velocity at the previous time step. If the time step $\\Delta t$ is chosen to be very small (relative to the time it takes for the force on the particle to change substantially), Euler's method can provide a very accurate approximation to the true Newtonian dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Velocity Verlet Integration ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, for practical purposes, Euler's method is not very useful: the time step $\\Delta t$ must be chosen *so small* that MD simulations for real systems become intractible. (Note that the number of computational steps in the simulation is proportional to the length of the simulation $t_\\text{sim}$ *divided by* the time step $\\Delta t$. So, for example, a 100 ns simulation with a 1 fs time step represents $10^{-7}/10^{-15} = 10^8$ simulation steps! For this reason, a variety of other integrators have been devised that allow for much larger time steps than the Euler method. Mathematically, these algorithms correspond to calculating a *second order* Taylor expansion for the position $x(t)$ at each time step. (We'll talk more about Taylor expansions in the coming weeks.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm we'll use in this class is *velocity Verlet* integration. The basic steps in velocity Verley integration are\n",
    "1. Calculate ${\\bf x}_n = {\\bf x}_{n-1} + {\\bf v}_{n-1} \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}{\\bf a}_{n-1} \\Delta t^2$.\n",
    "2. Calculate ${\\bf a}_n$ from the force function ${\\bf F}({\\bf x})$ and the new position ${\\bf x}_n$.\n",
    "3. Calculate ${\\bf v}_n = {\\bf v}_{n-1} + \\frac{{\\bf a}_n + {\\bf a}_{n-1}}{2} \\Delta t$ using the *average velocity* from the two most recent time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity Verlet algorithm is only slightly more complicated to code than the original Euler algorithm, but it affords a drastic stabilization of the dynamics. Similar methods include the Verley algorithm (in which the velocity is never explicitly calculated) and Leap Frog integration (where the velocity is calculated at the mid-point between position time-steps). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Particle in a Soft-Wall Box ##\n",
    "To see how MD integration works in practice, we'll repeat our particle-in-a-box MD simulation from last week with a particle contained in a \"soft wall\" box where the particle interacts with each wall via a potential of the form\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "V(r) = \\varepsilon_o \\frac{R_o^4}{r^4}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $r$ is the (shortest) distance between the particle and the wall, $\\varepsilon_o$ is an interaction energy parameter, and $R_o$ controls how closely the particle must approach the wall before it starts to be repelled. For example, the potential for the interaction of the particle with the left wall in our simulation box (running along the line ${\\bf x} = 0$) is \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "V^{(\\text{left})}({\\bf x}) = \\varepsilon_o \\frac{R_o^4}{x^4}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "From this potential, we calculate the force exerted on the particle by the left wall as\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "{\\bf F}^{(\\text{left})}({\\bf x}) = -\\nabla V^{(\\text{left})}({\\bf x}) = 4 \\varepsilon_o \\frac{R_o^4}{x^5}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Similarly, the potential for the right wall is given by \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "V^{(\\text{right})}({\\bf x}) = \\varepsilon_o \\frac{R_o^4}{(L-x)^4},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "leading to a force\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "{\\bf F}^{(\\text{right})}({\\bf x}) = - 4 \\varepsilon_o \\frac{R_o^4}{(L-x)^5}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Forces for interaction with the top and bottom of the box take similar forms but with $y$ in place of $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In implementing the algorithm, we can keep our code much cleaner by defining *functions* that calculate specific quantities -- e.g. the acceleration for a given particle position -- and then just calling them as we iterate through the simulation. In python, functions are defined by a `def` block. In the code below, we start by defining two functions, `calc_accel` (to calculate the acceleration on our particle at a given position) and `vv_step` that updates positions and velocities via a single step of the velocity Verlet algorithm. Notice here that although both functions take specific arguments (e.g., `calc_accel` takes the positions `x` and `y`), they can access other variables (e.g., L, dt, M, etc.) that are defined earlier in the code but not passed explicitly to the function. This can be very convenient, but it also means you'll have to pay attention to which variables have been defined! Along with introducing these two new functions, we define two new parameters, `epso` and `Ro`, corresponding to the particle/wall interaction parameters $\\varepsilon_o$ and $R_o$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the code is similar to what we ran last week, although we've updated all units to follow the cgs (centimeter-gram-second) system and made the box much smaller (only 10 nm long). We've also moved our plotting code inside of an `if(n%1000==0)` block that results in the plot updating only every 1000 time-steps. (Otherwise, the program spends most of its time updating the plot, and the simulation runs very slowly.) Once you've reviewed the code and think you understand roughly how it works, run it by pressing <shift+enter>."

    "*independent* of particle position. This assumption is justified when the wavelength of the radiation is long relative to the box size so that the field oscillates in sync across the entire box volume. The vector ${\\bf E}^{(\\text{max})}$ defines the direction in which the field is polarized and its maximum value. The frequency $\\nu$ indicates how rapidly the field oscillates in time, and $\\sigma$ represents the pulse length. According to the Lorentz force law, a particle with charge $q$ feels a force of $q {\\bf E}(t)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, the function ``gauss_pulse()`` calculates the $y$-component of the electric field from a Gaussian pulse polarized along the $y$ axis. The function ``calc_accel()`` is updated to include the Lorentz force acceleration on each particle, and the two plotting functions are updated to plot the electric field in a smaller window adjacent to the simulation box. Note that the electric field is specified in Gaussian (cgs) units of statV/cm. The box size has also been increased to 20 nm for purposes of visualization and stability. "
