    "\n",
    "First let's talk about Jupyter and Python. ***Python*** is a programming language -- a set of commands that can be translated (i.e. compiled) into the 1s and 0s that your computer can understand and run. Python is a relatively *high level* language, meaning that the compiler hides most of the details of how your program is actually executed by the computer. For example, in Python you can create a variable called \"x\" by just typing the command \"x = 3\". In a low-level programming language (e.g., Fortran or C), this would cause an error unless you had already warned the computer (\"declared\") that you were going to use a variable named \"x\". High-level programming languages like Python are usually easier to learn and faster to code in since the compiler handles many steps automatically. On the other hand, low-level languages tend to be more difficult to learn and use, but they offer greater control and -- when used properly -- can make for faster execution. \n",

    "The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to write and execute python programs (among other things) in your web browser. I recommend installing the Jupyter Notebook application as part of the Anaconda Distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Once the app is installed you can edit and run Jupyter Notebooks directly in your web browser. \n",

    "One of the primary computational methods we'll use in this course is *molecular dynamics* -- an iterative procedure in which classical systems are propagated through time according to Newton's equations. We'll discuss these methods in more detail shortly, but for now we'll adopt a _really_ simple version just to show you what Python code looks like. Specifically, we'll look at a single, hard-sphere particle moving in a squre (two-dimensional) box with hard walls. Each time the ball hits the wall, it simply bounces off, changing the direction of either its $x$ or $y$ velocity. \n",

The nickname is a name *you* come up with that you'll prepend to all commands you use from that library; preferably this should be short and memorable since you'll type it every time you wanto to reference the module. In the code snippet below, for example, we import matplotlib.pyplot as \"plt\". When we want to use the matplotlib `plot()` command, we'll actually type `plt.plot()` to indicate that the function `plot()` we want to use is part of the matplotlib.pyplot library."
