    "3. Now take a closer look at the spectra you calculated for the A/B and A/D dimers. In each case, what is the *splitting* (i.e., frequency difference) between the two absorption peaks? Compare this to the coupling values printed to the file \"coup.txt\" by the PigmentHunter window. (Note: this file is overwritten each time you calculate a new set of coupling values, so you may want to do the A/B and A/D PigmentHunter calculations again to make sure  you're looking at the right values.) Is the peak-to-peak splitting correlated with the value of the coupling constant? Why? "

    "4. Finally, let us examine the effect of introducing *bias* into the system, i.e., shifting the site energy of one pigment relative to the other. For both A/B and A/D configurations, calculate spectra with frequency differences of 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 cm$^{-1}$ between the two sites. How do the spectra differ? In each case, read off the $y$-value of the *lower intensity peak*, and plot this data (for both A/B and A/D systems) as a function of the frequency difference between the two sites. In which case do the spectra converge more rapidly to the sum spectrum of two isolated monomers? Why? "
