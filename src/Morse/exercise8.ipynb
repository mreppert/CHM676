How does the *width* of the pump-probe spectrum (in the frequency domain) change between these two simulations? What causes this \"broadening\"? "

Explain (using screenshots from the 2D simulation notebook) how 2D spectroscopy allows these different broadening mechanisms to be distinguished. (What key feature(s) do you look for?)\n"
