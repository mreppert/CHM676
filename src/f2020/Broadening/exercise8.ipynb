In your code cell, plot a spectrum calculated with $\\tau_{switch}$ value you identified.

Just be sure to label each curve using either ``plt.legend()`` or ``plt.title()`` commands.) "

    "Finally, run simulations in \"Normal\" mode with both $\\tau_{switch}$ = 10 fs and $\\tau_{switch}$ = 1 ps. Use **500 particles for each simulation**, since the averaging requirements are more stringent with the larger range of oscillator frequencies. Save the output from both simulations and plot the absorption spectra and SDF together on a single plot. (Use different line colors for the 10 fs and 1 ps curves, and use the `plt.legend()` command to label all three curves.) How do the two spectra differ? How do they compare to the SDF? Does each absorption spectrum more closely resemble a [*Gaussian* or *Lorentzian* line shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line_shape)? "
