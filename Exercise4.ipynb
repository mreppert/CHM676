    "# Nonlinear Response of a Morse Oscillator #\n",
    "\n",
    "In our last exercise, we calculated the absorption spectrum for a collection of harmonic oscillators using the *linear response* relation ${\\bf P}(\\omega) = \\chi^{(1)}(\\omega) {\\bf E}(\\omega)$. This week we'll take a look at the *nonlinear response* of a different kind of oscillator: the anharmonic *Morse oscillator*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Morse potential has the form\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "V(x) = D_e \\left( 1 - e^{-\\alpha x} \\right)^2\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "and often usually used as a model for anharmonic vibrations. The term \"anharmonic\" means exactly what it sounds like: \"not harmonic\". Although *linear* vibrational spectra can usually be understood in terms of the oscillation of strictly *harmonic* bonds (like we considered last week), *nonlinear* spectra must be understood in terms of anharmonic effects because, as we'll see today, nonlinear signals vanish identically for harmonic oscillators. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most physical applications, the coordinate $x$ in the Morse potential represents the *deviation of a bond length* away from its equilibrium value. In our last simulation, we explicitly modeled all (two-dimensional) degrees of freedom of our oscillators. For practical purposes, however, this is overkill. We saw last time that when we allowed our sample to interact with a laser pulse resonant with the bond vibrational frequency, the motion induced in the sample consisted almost entirely of bond stretching and compression. Rotational motion, for example, was almost absent since the pulse was not resonant with the rotational timescale of the molecules. For this reason, it is usually sufficient to consider a *reduced description* of our system of interest where we explicitly model only a few degrees of freedom. In this case, the degrees of freedom we model will be vibrational motion for a diatomic molecule with a Morse potential joining the two atims. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the harmonic potential, the Morse potential has two parameters, which determine both the oscillation frequency and the *anharmonicity* of the bond. The *anharmonicity* of the potential is determined by the dissociation energy $D_e$. This parameter specifies the energy needed to break the bond entirely, allowing the two atoms to fly away from each other. In our simulation, we'll keep the particle energy much smaller than $D_e$ so that our bond stays inteact. Nonetheless, even at these energies, anharmonic effects will be apparent in the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key characteristic of anharmonic models is that the *oscillation frequency is a function of the energy* of the system. For very small energies, when the coordinate $x$ stays close to zero, the Morse potential can be expanded to first order in a Taylor series to give \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "V(x) \\approx D_e \\alpha^2 x^2 \\equiv \\frac{k_o x^2}{2} .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Here $k_o$ is the harmonic force constant for the bond. When the amplitude of the motion is very small so that the first-order Taylor expansion is valid, motion in a Morse potential looks essentially harmonic with an oscillation frequency of $\\omega_o = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_o}{M}}$, with $M$ the oscillator (reduced) mass. Thus the Morse parameter $\\alpha$ can be related to the harmonic frequency $\\omega_o$ by the formula\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_o}{2 D_e}} .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below implements and plots an MD simulation for a single Morse oscillator. The figure on the left plots the position of the particle relative on the Morse potential energy surface as a function of time. The right panel plots the electric field and the induced dipole moment. (The oscillator is assumed to consist of two atoms with charges +Qo and -Qo. We're \"pretending\" here that the equilibrium bond length is exactly 0. This is obviously not physically correct, but it turns out to have no impact on the spectroscopy.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've looked over the code, run the simulation a few times, playing in particular with the parameter $D_e$. How does changing $D_e$ change the frequency of the oscillation? How does it change the shape of the potential? In what limit does the Morse potential converge to a harmonic potential? \n",
    "\n",
    "Look carefully also at the oscillator's motion. At high excitation energies (e.g., with a maximum electric field of $10^7$ statV/cm), does the particle spend more time on the right of left side of the $x=0$? Does it travel further to the right or the left? How does this relate to the curvature of the potential? Does the oscillator's motion more resemble harmonic motion when the amplitude of the motion is large or small? "

If our system really did respond linearly, the difference in absorption spectra for the two experiments would be exactly zero. The fact that (as we'll see shortly) we get a *nonzero difference* is evidence of the fact that our system is responding nonlinearly to the field. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference in absorption spectra we calculate here is closely related to a zero time-delay *pump probe* measurement. Pump-probe spectroscopy is a nonlinear measurement in which two different laser beams -- the \"pump\" and the \"probe\" are passed through a sample. Essentially, the pump-probe experiment measures the absorption spectrum of the sample using the second (\"probe\") pulse at a fixed time delay after excitation by the first (\"pump\") pulse. The pump-probe signal is usually reported as a change in optical density ($\\Delta$OD) corresponding to the absorption spectrum difference between \"pump on\" and \"pump off\" conditions. Our simulated experiment corresponds closely to a pump-probe spectrum with the time delay between pump and probe set to zero. \n",

    "1. Why does the Morse oscillator produce a nonlinear signal? I.e., what features of the oscillator's motion change with increasing field intensity? How does those changes reflect your earlier observations on the curvature of the potential? How is this reflected in the pump-probe spectrum? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. How does changing the magnitude of the electric field change the pump-probe spectrum? Is nonlinear response larger for small or large fields? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modify the code above to simulate an ensemble of $10^4$ oscillators -- you guessed it -- with random frequencies. Play with the width of the frequency distribution. How doese this change the spectrum? Does this correspond to dephasing or dissipation? What kind of broadening do you see in the spectrum: homogeneous or inhomogeneous? \n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: **THE CODE IS ALREADY VECTORIZED**. The only things you need to change to put in multiple oscillators is to generate a vector of random frequencies, create zero-vectors for the initial positions and velocities, and scale the dipole moments inversely with the number of oscillators you're simulating. \n",

    "It is a theorem of classical mechanics that all one-dimensional oscillatory systems can be written in terms of a special pair of variables $J$ and $\\theta$ known as the *action* and the *angle* respectively. The key characteristics of the action/angle variables is that $J$ is *static* in time, while $\\theta$ increases linearly in time: $\\theta = \\theta_o + \\omega(J) t$. Here $\\omega(J)$ is a function of $J$ and defines the *frequency* of the motion -- how long it takes for the system to return to complete a full cycle of motion. Further, the energy of the system is given by the expression\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "E(J) &= \\omega(J) J .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Loosely speaking, $J$ defines the energy of the classical system, while $\\theta$ defines its progression along its oscillatory cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The action and angle variables for the Morse oscillator can be solved analytically in terms of its position and momentum. The important point for us is that the frequency $\\omega(J)$ takes the form:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\omega(J) = \\omega_o \\left( 1 - \\omega_o \\frac{J}{2 D_e} \\right) .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "As the *action* increases, the frequency decreases up to some characteristic action $J_{\\text{max}}$ corresponding to dissociation of the oscillator bond. (Beyond this point, the expression is no longer valid.) This should correspond to your earlier observations that the frequency of the Morse oscillator motion decreases with increasing energy. \n",

    "In \"the Old Quantum Theory\" -- the framework developed in particular by Bohr, Sommerfeld, and Einstein -- quantum corrections were added to classical equations of motion in an (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to account for experimental observations. The central theme of this theory is that the action of one-dimensional systems takes on the quantized values $J_n = \\hbar \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)$, where $\\hbar$ is Planck's constant (divided by $2\\pi$). In this description, material systems were assumed to follow classical equations of motion, just with \"quantized actions\". Although ultimately found to be insufficient, the Old Quantum Theory played an important role in the development of quantum mechanics and is still used today in *semiclassical methods* for quantum dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the two formulas above for $E(J)$ and $\\omega(J)$, together with the quantization condition for the action $J_n$, calculate the energy of the $n^{\\text{th}}$ semiclassical state. Compare this to the $n^{\\text{th}}$ eigenvalue for the fully quantum Morse oscillator. (You'll have to look this up!) Does the Old Quantum Theory work well for this system? \n",

    "where $N$ is the order of the response and where each frequency $\\omega_n$ must be (roughly) plus or minus the laser excitation frequency. In our simulation, the laser excitation frequency is approximately $1650$ cm$^{-1}$. What order of nonlinear response do you think that the $\\Delta$OD signal that we've been plotting corresponds to? (Justify your answer based on the sum-frequency formula.) Based on the formula, do you expect that there should be nonlinear response in other frequency ranges in our simulation? Are there?
