    "# Exercise 5\n",
    "\n",
    "The conceptual content of this exercise consists of two parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, you'll learn how to calculate absorption spectra from the field-inducted polarization of a sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Second, you'll examine how the absorption spectrum changes in response to factors like temperature and viscosity. \n",
    "\n",
    "As input for these calculations, you'll use simulation data you saved using the main LangevinAbsorption app. For each question, you'll need to run a simulation and import the correct data into your code. The first section below walks you through this process step by step. The second section directs you to run specific simulations, import the corresponding data, and answer questions based on your calculations with that data. \n",

    "## Step-by-step Absorption Spectrum Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section walks through an absorption spectrum calculation step-by-step. After each instruction, type the necessary code directly into the corresponding cell and execute it. If there's an error in one of the cells *fix it before you move to the next step!*\n",
    "\n",
    "0. First run a simulation using the main LangevinAbsorption app. A text file containing a time axis, a field trajectory, and a polarization trajectory will be automatically saved for you in your local MolSpec directory. A good set of input parameters for this simulation would be to run a simulation with 200 molecules, $t_{max} = 10$ ps, and $\\nu_{pulse}$ = 50 THz. (You don't need any code for this step -- just run the simulation and make note of the file name). \n",

    "3. Calculate the Fourier transform of the polarization and the electric field using the `np.fft.ifft()` method. Take note! We're using here the NumPy **inverse** FFT algorithm (`np.fft.ifft()`) rather than the **forward** FT algorithm (`np.fft.fft()`) because NumPy uses the *opposite sign convention* in its FT calculations than in our lectures! Whereas we define the *forward* transform as $$ \\tilde f(\\omega) = \\int dt\\; f(t) \\; e^{i\\omega t},$$ and the *inverse* transform as $$f(t)= \\int d\\omega \\; \\tilde f(\\omega) \\; e^{-i\\omega t},$$ NumPy *reverses the sign conventions in the exponents*. By using the `np.fft.ifft()` algorithm for *forward* transforms and the `np.fft.fft()` algorithm for *inverse* transforms, we match the convention in the lecture notes. "

    "5. Identify *which two indices* `ndx1` *and* `ndx2` *in your frequency axis* correspond to the two frequencies `f1 = ` 45 THz and `f2 = ` 55 THz. One way to do this is to use the `np.argmin()` function. For example, to find the index in `faxis` whose entry is closest to `f1`, you can write <br><br>`ndx1 = np.argmin(np.abs(faxis-f1))`.<br><br> The ``np.argmin`` function finds the *index* of the smallest entry in a give vector; by passing it the vector `np.abs(faxis-f1)` we find the index in `faxis` whose value is closest to `f1`.
