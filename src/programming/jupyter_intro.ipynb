    "## The Kernel and Variable Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on, it's worth commenting on one important but sometimes confusing feature of the Jupyter Notebook: the persistence and scope of stored variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you open an ipynb file, Jupyter starts a new \"kernel\" or background process that keeps track of what code has been executed and what variables have been defined. When you first open the notebook, no variables exist, even if the notebook contains code that would define them *if executed*. To make the kernel aware of these variables, you must first execute the corresponding cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how this works, let's suppose we open a new notebook with two code cells. The first contains the single line \n",
    "\n",
    ">``x = 3``\n",
    "\n",
    "while the second contains only\n",
    "\n",
    ">``print(x)``\n",
    "\n",
    "If executed in sequence, the first code would produce no output, while the second would simply print ``3``. If you were to open the file and *instead of executing in sequence* execute the *second* cell *first*, the output would show an Error, complaining that the variable ``x`` had never been defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "The counterpoint here is that *once a variable has been defined, it is accessible to all cells in the notebook*. So, for example, if our ipynb file contained the same two cells illustrated above but in *reverse order*, it would throw an error if the first cell (``print(x)``) were executed first, but not if the *second* cell (``x = 3``) were executed first and *then* the first cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Confusing? Well, it can be. What's worse is that, once a variable has been executed, it lives on in the kernel *even if the corresponding code is deleted from the notebook*. So if we were to execute our ``x = 3``, the variable ``x`` would persist with the value ``3`` *even if we were to delete the cell* ``x = 3`` *from the notebook*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables **are** deleted, however, whenever the kernel is shut down or restarted. On nanoHUB, this happens automatically any time the \"Terminate Session\" button is clicked or when you log out of nanoHUB. When this happens, all data and variables that were generated by executing the code are lost unless stored in another file. (Note: Output remains displayed on the screen, but the kernel will *not* remember anymore the variables that were used to generate it.) \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also restart the kernel manually by selecting one of the several options on the ``Kernel`` tab on the Jupyter control bar. If your code is behaving strangely, it's sometimes a good idea to try restarting the kernel, since odd behavior can sometimes be caused by \"ghost\" variables that have lived on past the deletion of their corresponding code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outlook\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to interactively edit, compile, and run both Python and text-formatting code in a single document makes Jupyter Notebooks a powerful interface for scientific computing. To get a sense for how this works, we'll next introduce some basic Markdown and Python syntax. "
