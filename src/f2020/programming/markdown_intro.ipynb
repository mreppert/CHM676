    "\n",
    "*Markdown* is a text formatting language that allows the user to define rich-format text using only plain-text inputs. Importantly for our purposes, equations can be typeset using LaTeX, another (more complete) typesetting language. Since homework for this course will be returned in Jupyter Notebook format, you'll need to learn basic Markdown and LaTex syntax to complete your assignments. Although you'll want to pick up some additional LaTex vocabulary along the way, this introduction will get you started. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Review: Markdown in Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "By way of a quick review:\n",
    "* In a Jupyter notebook, you can enter richly formatted text by creating a new cell and then selecting \"Markdown\" from the Code/Markdown drop-down menu in the middle of the toolbar. \n",
    "* You can then create Markdown content by just clicking and typing in the new cell. \n",
    "* To display the content in rich format, just hit <Shift+Enter> or <Ctrl+Enter> as with a code cell. \n",
    "* To see the source code for rich-format text, double click on the text to open the corresponding Markdown cell. (You must have Appmode turned off). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Line Breaks\n",
    "\n",
    "Paragraphs in Markdown must be separated by a full blank line in the input code; a single line break is insufficient. So, for example, this input\n",
    "\n",
    ">``This is some text for formatting. ``<br>``Markdown considers this line part of the same paragraph.``\n",
    "\n",
    "will produce the output\n",
    "\n",
    ">This is some text for formatting. \n",
    ">Markdown considers this line part of the same paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, this input\n",
    "\n",
    ">``This is some text for formatting. ``<br><br>``Markdown considers this to be a new paragraph.``\n",
    "\n",
    "will produce the output\n",
    "\n",
    ">This is some text for formatting. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Markdown considers this to be a new paragraph. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although it's not often necessary, if you want to insert a *single* line break (i.e., not the default double spacing between paragraphs) you can do it using the HTML flag ``<br>``. E.g., \n",
    "\n",
    ">``This is a<br> line break.``\n",
    "\n",
    "is rendered\n",
    "\n",
    ">This is a<br> line break.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "Headings of various sizes are produced in Markdown by adding a variable number of hash symbols (\\#), followed by a space, before the line of text. A single \\# produces the largest available text size, \\#\\# produces the next largest, and so on. For example, the code\n",
    "\n",
    ">``# This is a heading``<br><br>``## This is a sub-heading``<br><br>``## This is a sub-sub-heading``\n",
    "\n",
    "produces the output\n",
    "\n",
    "># This is a heading\n",
    ">## This is a sub-heading\n",
    ">## This is a sub-sub-heading\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changing Font Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, text is displayed without emphasis by the Markdown compiler, i.e., without bold or italic emphasis. To italicise a portion of the text, simply enclose it inside a pair of asterisks (\\*). For example, the Markdown code\n",
    "\n",
    ">``Markdown can *italicise* text.``\n",
    "\n",
    "will (when executed) create the display\n",
    "\n",
    ">Markdown can *italicise* text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to print text in bold font, enclose it within a double-pair of asterisks. E.g., \n",
    "\n",
    ">``Markdown can display **bold** text.``\n",
    "\n",
    "produces\n",
    "\n",
    ">Markdown can display **bold** text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changing Font Color\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown uses HTML syntax for font colors. For example, the syntax\n",
    "\n",
    ">``Markdown can print <span style=\"color:red\">red</span> text .``\n",
    "\n",
    "produces the output \n",

    "## Using LaTex\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LaTex is a powerful typesetting language common in technical fields due to the ease with which it produces nicely formatted equations. You can tell Markdown to format a particular string of text using the LaTex language by simply encasing it in either a single or double pair of dollar signs. Text enclosed in single signs will be LaTex-rendered in-line with the surrounding text, while text enclosed in double signs will be printed on a separate line. For example, the line\n",
    "\n",
    ">``My favorite equation is $e^{i \\pi} + 1 = 0$.``\n",
    "\n",
    "is rendered\n",
    "\n",
    ">My favorite equation is $e^{i \\pi} + 1 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line \n",
    "\n",
    ">``My favorite equation is $$e^{i \\pi} + 1 = 0$$.``\n",

    "## Basic Latex Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The example above already illustrates some basic LaTex features:\n",
    "* Greek characters can be specified by spelling the name, preceded by a backslash. E.g., ``\\pi`` codes for $\\pi$. \n",
    "* The ``^`` operator renders the following text as a superscript.\n",
    "* The curly braces ``{`` and ``}`` are used to group text items. In the example above the syntax ``^{i \\pi}`` indicates that the entire quantity $i \\pi$ should be included in the superscript. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond these basics, you'll for the most part have to learn LaTex syntax as you go. But to get you started, here are a few more useful elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``\\cdot`` codes for the center dot $\\cdot$ often used for multiplication.\n",
    "* ``\\times`` codes for the crossed multiplication symbol $\\times$ used in this course for vector cross products.\n",
    "* ``\\frac{a}{b}`` codes for the formatted fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$, where ``a`` and ``b`` can be replaced with any valid combination of LaTex symbols. \n",
    "* Many common mathematical functions can be specified using a backslash and the name or abbreviation. For example,\n",
    "    * ``\\sin(x)`` codes for $\\sin(x)$\n",
    "    * ``\\cos(x)`` codes for $\\cos(x)$\n",
    "    * ``\\ln(x)`` codes for $\\ln(x)$\n",
    "    * ``\\exp(x)`` codes for $\\exp(x)$\n",
    "* The keywords ``\\left`` and ``\\right`` are used to create pairs of open- and close-parentheticals (parentheses, brackets, braces, etc.) with each other. This allows LaTex to automatically adjust the size of the symbol according to what's inside. For example, the code\n",
    "\n",
    ">``$F(\\frac{\\vec A \\cdot \\vec B}{C})$``\n",
    "\n",
    "produces the somewhat unsightly result\n",
    "\n",
    ">$F(\\frac{\\vec A \\cdot \\vec B}{C})$, \n",
    "\n",
    "whereas the code \n",
    "\n",
    ">``$F \\left (\\frac{\\vec A \\cdot \\vec B}{C} \\right)$``\n",
    "\n",
    "produces the more pleasing output\n",
    "\n",
    ">$F \\left (\\frac{\\vec A \\cdot \\vec B}{C} \\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the size of the parentheses have been adjusted to accomodate the argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond this quick-start introduction, you'll mostly have to learn LaTex syntax as you go. Fortunately, the language is widely enough used that a quick internet search is usually enough to locate the correct syntax. In this course, any new symbols needed to complete the homework will usually be used already in the Jupyter Notebook that assigns the homework. In this case, you can always learn the new syntax by just double-clicking on the corresponding Jupyter Notebook cell to see the Markdown source code. "
