    "# Langevin Dynamics #\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture this week, we introduced the concept of *macroscopic* observables: ensemble averages of microscopic observables over all microstates consistent with a given set of macroscopic constraints. Modeling macroscopic properties numerically can be taxing. In principle, we *could* try to calculate the bulk properties of a glass of water using a macroscopic number ($\\sim10^{23}$) of particles, but in practice real computers can't even store all the necessary data, let alone run the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### MD Thermostats ###\n",
    "\n",
    "To get around this problem, computational chemists have constructed a variety of methods designed to run an MD simulation with a *small* number of particles that behave as though they're interacting with a much larger number of particles. MD *thermostats*, for example, stabilize the average kinetic energy of particles in an MD simulation -- a proxy for the macroscopic temperature. Similarly, *barostats* stabilize the average pressure exerted by the particles running into the simulation box walls. In this exercise, we'll implement a simple thermostat using *Langevin dynamics*, an extension of molecular dynamics in which each particle feels (in addition to forces from other simulation particles) randomly-generated forces that simulate interaction with a large number of \"solvent\" particles whose microscopic coordinates aren't explicitly included in the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Langevin Dynamics for Solvation ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Langevin dynamics originated in the study of Brownian motion -- the diffusion of mesoscopic particles (like pollen grains) in a solvent. A key assumption in the Langevin treatment is that the solvent particle is much larger than the solute molecules around it. As a result of that difference in scale, a careful theory can be worked out that allows us to explicitly follow the coordinates and momenta of the solute molecule, while treating the solvent molecules implicitly through their influence on the solvent particles. For a single solute particle, the Langevin equation reads\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "M \\ddot {\\bf r}(t) &= {\\bf F}({\\bf r},t) - \\gamma \\dot {\\bf r} + {\\bf \\xi}(t).\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "In the absence of the last two terms, this would simply be Newton's equation: ${\\bf F} = M {\\bf a}$. Here ${\\bf F}({\\bf r},t)$ is the deterministic force (if any) the particle would feel in the absence of interactions with the solvent. The last two terms represent (in an approximate way) the impact of the solvent on the solute dynamics. The $- \\gamma \\dot {\\bf r}$ is proportional to the particle velocity ${\\bf v} = - \\gamma \\dot {\\bf r}$ and describes the *viscous drag* or friction that the solute particle experiences as a result of constantly running into solvent molecules. The second term, ${\\bf \\xi}(t)$ is a random force that represents the constantly-fluctuating force exerted on the particle by the surrounding solvent: sometimes the particle gets \"kicked\" up, sometimes down, sometimes left, sometimes right, all depending on the microscopic trajectories of the solvent molecules around it. Since we don't want to actually *calculate* all those microscopic solvent trajectories, the force ${\\bf \\xi}(t)$ in our simulation will be a random variable. Because the microscopic configuration of the solvent is assumed to change much more quickly than the position of the solute particle, the random force ${\\bf \\xi}(t)$ is taken to be *delta-correlated*, i.e., the value of the force at different time points $t_1$ and $t_2$ are assumed to be statistically independent of each other. For thermodynamic consistency, it can then be shown that the random force must satisfy the *fluctuation-dissipation relation* \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\left \\langle {\\bf \\xi}(t_2) {\\bf \\xi}(t_1) \\right \\rangle = 2 \\gamma k_B T \\delta(t_2 - t_1)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "for any two time points $t_1$ and $t_2$. Of course, the assumption of a delta-correlated random force is an approximation. In the real world, there should always be *some* time scale (perhaps very short) over which the solvent forces remain correlated at different time points. For this reason, a key limitation to Langevin dynamics is that we only study dynamics on time scales *much longer* than this solvent correlation time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical implementation of Langevin dynamics is slightly more complicated than plain-vanilla MD (mostly due to the appearance of the delta function in the noise correlation). For this simulation, we'll use an adapted Velocity-Verlet like algorithm published here: *Molecular Physics*, **111**, 983â€“991 (2013). You aren't responsible for understanding or coding the algorithm -- you'll just have to run the code -- although as usual you're encouraged to have a look anyway. Areas with major changes are marked by comment headings. After looking through the code, modify parameters to answer the questions in the text below it. "

    "## Langevin Dynamics for Spectroscopy ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In spectroscopy, of course, we aren't really interested in diffusion per se. Our interest is in the much faster time scales (fs to ns) of electronic and vibrational motion. Even in this context, however, Langevin dynamics allow us to capture several physical effects important in spectroscopy. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, Langevin dynamics allow us to control the average kinetic energy -- i.e., temperature -- of the particles in our simulation. This allows us to speak meaningfully of a simulation box being \"equilibrated\" and, in principle, can be used to study (on a small scale) processes like phase transitions from solid to liquid or the temperature-induced folding or unfolding of a protein. (You should have seen behavior related to this in the simulations you just ran. ) In as much as having the right initial starting state is critical to getting the right spectroscopic signal, Langevin dynamics are thus quite important in spectroscopic simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, and of special relevance to spectroscopy, Langevin dynamics allows us to study the effects of *dissipation* and *dephasing* in optical and infrared spectroscopy. *Dissipation* is the process by which an initially excited system loses energy to its environment. Dephasing (or decoherence) is the process by which intially coherent motion -- i.e. oscillations with a well-defined phase relative to the initial state -- becomes randomized. Although they may seem like abstract concepts, dephasing and dissipation both play critical roles in the determination of optical and infrared lineshapes and in energy-transfer processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll get our first taste of the way MD simulations can be used to evaluate spectroscopic signals, particularly in the presence of dissipation. As a simple molecular model, we'll consider a collection of diatomic molecules with parameters roughly matching those of a C=O bond. The main changes required to implement this model in our code are (1) to update the particle-placement code so that positive and negative particles are always distributed pair-wise (each pair representing a single molecule) and (2) to add to the ``calc_accel()`` routine a contribution from the bonding force between the two atoms in the molecule. In our simple model, the bonding force within each molecule is described by a harmonic potential\n",

    "## The Polarization Density ##\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned in lecture that molecular spectroscopy is primarily a study of the response of the polarization density ${\\bf P}({\\bf x},t)$ to the electric field. In this section, we'll calculate the polarization for a \"mini-ensemble\" of dipoles subjected to an external field. By \"mini-ensemble,\" of course, we just mean a large number of dipoles with random initial conditions placed in a simulation box in such a way that (for the most part) they don't interact with each other. The code below runs a simulation with such a mini-ensemble and then plots the polarization along the $y$-axis (i.e. the average $y$ component of the dipole moment) as a function of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from changing parameter values and plotting the polarization, the only new addition to this code is the introduction of the function ``place_mols()`` that places molecules in the simulation box a bit more carefully. The new function places molecules randomly in the box just like always, but (to avoid instability) it then checks to make sure that molecules aren't too close to each other; it repeats this process a large number of times, exiting either when it successfully places the molecules stably in the box or when it reaches the maximum number of allowed iterations. Note that the *only* reason for adding this function is to allow us to place more particles in the box without causing our simulation to blow up. \n",

    "Small molecules like the simple C=O models we studied here can undergo rotational diffusion on a sub-picosecond time scale. How do you think this affects their vibrational spectrum in the C=O stretch region? (Hint: think about how rotation affects the induced polarization.) Is this an example of dissipation or dephasing? Should the effect of rotational diffusion on the vibrational spectrum be larger for small molecules (e.g., carbon monoxide) or big molecules (e.g., a protein)? \n",
