    "\n",
    "In our last exercise, we calculated the absorption spectrum for a collection of harmonic oscillators using the *linear response* relation ${\\bf P}(\\omega) = \\chi^{(1)}(\\omega) {\\bf E}(\\omega)$. This week we'll take a look at the *nonlinear response* of a different kind of oscillator: the anharmonic *Morse oscillator*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Morse potential has the form\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "V(x) = D_e \\left( 1 - e^{-\\alpha x} \\right)^2\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "and often usually used as a model for anharmonic vibrations. The term \"anharmonic\" means exactly what it sounds like: \"not harmonic\". Although *linear* vibrational spectra can usually be understood in terms of the oscillation of strictly *harmonic* bonds (like we considered last week), *nonlinear* spectra must be understood in terms of anharmonic effects because, as we'll see today, nonlinear signals vanish identically for harmonic oscillators. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most physical applications, the coordinate $x$ in the Morse potential represents the *deviation of a bond length* away from its equilibrium value. In our last simulation, we explicitly modeled all (two-dimensional) degrees of freedom of our oscillators. For practical purposes, however, this is overkill. We saw last time that when we allowed our sample to interact with a laser pulse resonant with the bond vibrational frequency, the motion induced in the sample consisted almost entirely of bond stretching and compression. Rotational motion, for example, was almost absent since the pulse was not resonant with the rotational timescale of the molecules. For this reason, it is usually sufficient to consider a *reduced description* of our system of interest where we explicitly model only a few degrees of freedom. In this case, the degrees of freedom we model will be vibrational motion for a diatomic molecule with a Morse potential joining the two atims. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the harmonic potential, the Morse potential has two parameters, which determine both the oscillation frequency and the *anharmonicity* of the bond. The *anharmonicity* of the potential is determined by the dissociation energy $D_e$. This parameter specifies the energy needed to break the bond entirely, allowing the two atoms to fly away from each other. In our simulation, we'll keep the particle energy much smaller than $D_e$ so that our bond stays inteact. Nonetheless, even at these energies, anharmonic effects will be apparent in the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key characteristic of anharmonic models is that the *oscillation frequency is a function of the energy* of the system. For very small energies, when the coordinate $x$ stays close to zero, the Morse potential can be expanded to first order in a Taylor series to give \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "V(x) \\approx D_e \\alpha^2 x^2 \\equiv \\frac{k_o x^2}{2} .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Here $k_o$ is the harmonic force constant for the bond. When the amplitude of the motion is very small so that the first-order Taylor expansion is valid, motion in a Morse potential looks essentially harmonic with an oscillation frequency of $\\omega_o = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_o}{M}}$, with $M$ the oscillator (reduced) mass. Thus the Morse parameter $\\alpha$ can be related to the harmonic frequency $\\omega_o$ by the formula\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_o}{2 D_e}} .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below implements and plots an MD simulation for a single Morse oscillator. The figure on the left plots the position of the particle relative on the Morse potential energy surface as a function of time. The right panel plots the electric field and the induced dipole moment. (The oscillator is assumed to consist of two atoms with charges +Qo and -Qo. We're \"pretending\" here that the equilibrium bond length is exactly 0. This is obviously not physically correct, but it turns out to have no impact on the spectroscopy.) \n",

    "## Pump-Probe Spectroscopy ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, once you've explored the simulation parameters a bit, let's use the simulation to calculate a spectroscopic signal. Specifically, we'll calculate the *difference* in absorption spectra for the oscillators excited with the two different laser fields, calculated using our linear response formula \n",

If our system really did respond linearly, the difference in absorption spectra for the two experiments would be exactly zero. The fact that (as we'll see shortly) we get a *nonzero difference* is evidence of the fact that our system is responding nonlinearly to the field. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference in absorption spectra we calculate here is closely related to a zero time-delay *pump probe* measurement. Pump-probe spectroscopy is a nonlinear measurement in which two different laser beams -- the \"pump\" and the \"probe\" are passed through a sample. Essentially, the pump-probe experiment measures the absorption spectrum of the sample using the second (\"probe\") pulse at a fixed time delay after excitation by the first (\"pump\") pulse. The pump-probe signal is usually reported as a change in optical density ($\\Delta$OD) corresponding to the absorption spectrum difference between \"pump on\" and \"pump off\" conditions. Our simulated experiment corresponds closely to a pump-probe spectrum with the time delay between pump and probe set to zero. \n",

    "* ``Emax`` (the maximum amplitude of the electric field) set to 1e+6 statV/cm\n",
    "These parameters will ensure both good frequency resolution and that the signal decays to zero within the simulation window. You may also want to change the sampling frequency to a larger number (e.g., change the final ``for`` loop to read ``if(n%100==0)``) to make the code run faster. \n",

    "4. We learned in class that nonlinear signals must satisfy a frequency-sum condition $$\\omega = \\omega_1 + \\omega_2 + ... + \\omega_N$$ where $N$ is the order of the response and where each frequency $\\omega_n$ must be (roughly) plus or minus the laser excitation frequency. In our simulation, the laser excitation frequency is approximately $1650$ cm$^{-1}$. What order of nonlinear response do you think that the $\\Delta$OD signal that we've been plotting corresponds to? (Justify your answer based on the sum-frequency formula.) Based on the formula, do you expect that there should be nonlinear response in other frequency ranges in our simulation? Are there?
