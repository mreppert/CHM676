    "In this exercise, you'll perform a series of MD simulations involving charged particles in the presence of an electromagnetic field. The main simulation code is provided for you. For each computational question, you will:\n",
    "* Copy and paste relevant code into a new code cell,\n",
    "* Make modifications (as directed),\n",
    "* Run the simulation, and \n",
    "* Report on your observations in Markdown-formatted text.\n",

    "### Expected content\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers to questions 1 - 3 should include:\n",
    "* Working simulation code in a cell block immediately below the question statement.\n",
    "* All output generated by your simulation code (don't \"clear output\" before you save your notebook).\n",
    "* A Markdown-formatted answer to the question immediately below the simulation code output. Blank Markdown cells are provided: double click in the text \"Type Markdown and LaTeX: $\\alpha^2$\" just below the relevant simulation code block. \n",

    "There are two main code blocks needed for this exercise: \n",
    "* **MD Setup**: The code block *immediately below this cell* and labeled \"Simulation Setup\" needs to be executed only once. It imports relevant libraries and defines useful functions and constants needed for the MD simulation. You do **not** need to copy this code in the answers to your questions since it will never be modified. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **MD Run**: The code block provided *immediately below Question 1* runs the MD simulation. All parameters are initially set to the values needed to answer Question 1. You will then copy and paste this code into the cell blocks below Questions 2 and 3, modify it as needed, and use the modified code to answer the questions. \n"
