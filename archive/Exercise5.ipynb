    "# Pump-Probe Spectroscopy #\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we looked at the nonlinear response of a Morse oscillator by calculating the absorption spectrum at low and high pulse amplitudes. We claimed that this signal corresponds roughly to a pump-probe spectrum in which the pump and the probe are overlapped in time. This week, we'll run a simulation that much more accurately describes pump-probe spectroscopy, this time with a variable time-delay between pump and probe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: Experimental Setup ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Pump-probe spectroscopy is a nonlinear technique that, loosely speaking, can be understood as monitoring the *difference* in sample absorption with and without prior excitation. Experimentally, the sample is hit with two laser pulses, propagating along different axes as shown in the figure below. (You can ignore the code.) The *pump* pulse is \"chopped\" by a rapidly-rotating blade which blocks every other laser pulse. The *probe* pulse (which is not chopped) is used to measure an absorption spectrum with every laser pulse. The \"pump-probe\" signal is just the *difference* between probe-measured absorption spectra with and without the pump. \n"

    "## Response Function Contributions ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Based simply on this description, it's possible (see Appendix) to deduce (in the short-pulse limit) that the measured pump-probe signal is proportional to the quantity\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    S^{(\\text{pp})}(\\omega) &\\propto \\varepsilon_\\text{pump}^2 \\varepsilon_\\text{probe} \\int d\\omega_1 \\left [ \\tilde R_{yyyy}^{(3)}(-\\omega_1, 0, \\omega) + \\tilde R_{yyyy}^{(3)}(\\omega_1, 0, \\omega) \\right],\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\varepsilon_\\text{pump}$ and $\\varepsilon_\\text{probe}$ are amplitudes for the pump and probe fields, and $R_{yyyy}^{(3)}(\\omega_1,\\omega_2,\\omega_3)$ is the Fourier-transformed third-order response tensor. The only constraint is that the frequency $\\omega_1$ must be positive and near the laser excitation frequency. Thus the pump-probe signal is a linear combination of two response-function terms that oscillate with frequencies\n",
    "* Near either plus or minus the laser excitation frequency in $\\tau_1$,\n",
    "* Near 0 in $\\tau_2$, and \n",
    "* Again at optical frequencies in $\\tau_3$ (usually near the laser excitation frequency). \n",
    "\n",
    "The two response function terms $\\tilde R_{yyyy}^{(3)}(-\\omega_1, 0, \\omega)$ and $\\tilde R_{yyyy}^{(3)}(\\omega_1, 0, \\omega)$ are called the *rephasing* and *nonrephasing* signals, respectively, and correspond to the wavevector sum conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rephasing:** $ \\quad\\quad {\\bf k}_\\text{sig} = - {\\bf k}_1 + {\\bf k}_2 + {\\bf k}_3 $\n",

    "**Nonrephasing:** $ \\quad\\quad {\\bf k}_\\text{sig} = + {\\bf k}_1 - {\\bf k}_2 + {\\bf k}_3$. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the same terms that contribute to two-dimensional correlation spectra. In fact, the primary difference between pump-probe spectroscopy and 2D correlation spectroscopy is that 2D spectroscopy resolves the frequency $\\omega_1$ of the initial interaction *as well as* the frequency $\\omega_\\text{sig}$ of the final interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical Evaluation ##\n",
    "\n",
    "To study this process numerically, we'll consider an experiment in which a Morse oscillator is excited by two Gaussian pulses, characterized by the fields ${\\bf E}_{\\text{pu}}$ (pump) and ${\\bf E}_{\\text{pr}}$ (probe). The total electric field that hits the sample will have the form\n",
    "$${\\bf E} = \\varepsilon_\\text{pu} {\\bf E}_\\text{pu} + \\varepsilon_\\text{pr} {\\bf E}_\\text{pr},$$\n",
    "where the coefficients $\\varepsilon_\\text{pu}$ and $\\varepsilon_\\text{pr}$ scale the amplitude of the two pulses. In our simulation, we'll select out those components from the *total* response that have the same characteristics as the response function terms we just identified. Namely, we need signal that\n",
    "1. Scales linearly with $\\varepsilon_\\text{probe}$,\n",
    "2. Scales nonlinearly with $\\varepsilon_\\text{pump}$, and\n",
    "3. Does not oscillate as a function of the time-delay between the pump and probe. (This corresponds to the fact that the second frequency argument in our response functions is zero.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as we did in our last exercise, we can select for signals with the correct scaling properties (requirements 1 and 2) by taking sums and differences of the *total* polarization under different amplitudes of the perturbing field. Specifically (see Appendix 2), the signal we want turns out to be \n",
    "$${\\bf P}_\\text{2pu,pr}^{(3)} \\propto {\\bf P}[2 \\varepsilon_\\text{pu},\\varepsilon_\\text{pr}] - {\\bf P}[0,\\varepsilon_\\text{pr}] - {\\bf P}[2 \\varepsilon_\\text{pu},0] - 2 \\left( {\\bf P}[\\varepsilon_\\text{pu},\\varepsilon_\\text{pr}] - {\\bf P}[0,\\varepsilon_\\text{pr}] - {\\bf P}[\\varepsilon_\\text{pu},0] \\right)$$\n",
    "Here the notation ${\\bf P}[a_1,a_2]$ indicates the induced polarization in a simulation where the pump electric field has amplitude $a_1$ and the probe field has amplitude $a_2$. This is a quantity we can easily evaluate numerically by simply running simulations with different field amplitudes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that this signal is **not** guaranteed to oscillate near zero frequency as a function of the time delay between the pulses. This is something that we'll have to check explicitly and, if necessary, filter in the frequency domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "In preparation for this simulation, the code below encloses the numerical simulation from last week into a single function ``calc_response(Efield)`` whose only argument is the electric field profile used to excite the sample. Other than this rearrangement (and the elimination of the segments that plot the Morse oscillator at each time step), the code is identical to what we used last week. "

    "The main thing you probably notice is that the polarization seems to \"beat\" as a function of the time dealy $\\tau$ between the pulses. This behavior *strongly* resembles the \"quantum beating\" behavior sometimes observed in nonlinear spectroscopies. Note, however, that these beats are determined entirely by linear response! They actually arise from interference between the oscillator's independent *linear* response terms to both pulses: When the time delay between the pulses is an integer multiple of the Morse oscillation period, the two linear response terms add constructively to enhance the signal. When the delay is a half-integer multiple of the oscillation period, the two linear response contributions interfere *destructively*, killing the signal. This interpretation is reinforced by the observation that the \"beats\" complete a full cycle every 20 fs, corresponding to the harmonic oscillation frequency of our Morse oscillator. \n",

The next code block evaluates the \"two-pump/one probe\" signal described in the introduction as a function of the inter-pulse delay $\\tau$ **and** converts that response to the frequency domain in order to obtain a pump-probe-like signal. As in our last simulation, the frequency-domain response is divided by the frequency-spectrum of the probe pulse to produce an absorptive (difference) signal. \n",

    "1. How does the pump-probe spectrum change with the damping coefficient $\\gamma$? Try, for example, $\\gamma = 100$ pg/s vs $\\gamma = 200$ pg/s.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. How does the pump-probe spectrum change when the simulation includes randomized frequencies? (Youm may want to use a relatively small value for $\\gamma$, e.g., 50 pg/s so that you can clearly see the effect of the frequency randomization.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From your last two answers (and what you've learned in your previous exercises), name one advantage of nonlinear measurements over absorption spectroscopy. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Answers ##\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Along the frequency axis $\\omega_{sig}$, the signal broadens as $\\gamma$ increases. Along the time axis $\\tau$, the signal decays more quickly as $\\gamma$ increases. Both effects result from the dissipation of the nonlinear polarization due to the friction. Note: Since our simulation has a temperature of zero (and thus no thermal fluctuations), $\\gamma$ represents *only* dissipation in this simulation, making no contribution to dephasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The spectrum broadens along the frequency axis $\\omega_{sig}$ **but remains unchanged** along the time axis $\\tau$. This reflects an important characteristic of pump-probe spectroscopy: although the $\\omega_{sig}$ width is sensitive to both dephasing **and** dissipation, the decay as a function of the inter-pulse delay $\\tau$ is determined only by **dissipation**. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. These observations illustrate one of the key advantages of nonlinear spectroscopies: The ability to separate the contributions of dephasing and dissipation from each other by dispersing the signal along multiple time/frequency axes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus: Note that hole-burning spectroscopy -- which can likewise be used to separate population decay from static dephasing (i.e., inhomogeneous broadening -- is also formally a third-order experiment since the \"burn\" event is triggered by two interactions with the burn laser and since the final absorption measurement involves one more interaction with the measuring excitation source. In fact, hole burning can in many ways be viewed as a low-temperature version of pump-probe spectroscopy, where the nonlinear response to the \"pump\" pulse (i.e., the continuous-wave laser) is locked in place by the ultra-low temperature of the system. In hole burning, of course, the system \"excitation\" corresponds to a change in transition **frequency** rather than to the population of an electronic excited state. "

Furthermore, just like in the linear case, any nonlinear signals that depend *only* on the probe field will be subtracted out in the \"pump-on minus pump-off\" processing.
