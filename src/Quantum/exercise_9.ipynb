    "For this assignment, you'll need to copy-and-paste the code blocks from the \"Quantum Morse\" notebook into the code block below. Use this as a chance to review the code and get a sense for what it does. You **don't** need to study the entire code in detail, but it is important that you understand what each code block is accomplishing. You will need access to the Harmonic Oscillator wavefunctions and energies, as well as the Morse oscillator energies to complete the assignment, so be sure to note where these variables are defined in the code.

What is the \"selection rule\" for the harmonic oscillator that dictates which quantum states can transition to each other due to electromagnetic excitation? "
